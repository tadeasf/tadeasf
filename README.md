## About Me

I found coding a little later in life while doing my masters. I haven't finished the latter, but picked up enough python there to propel me as data analyst at daytrip.com. During three years there I learned how to build scalable containerized backend APIs and ETL pipelines as well as plenty of typescript. Then I moved to kiwi where I've worked on the industrial scraping backend machine and learned a lot about setting up highly performant applications in very short time.
Recently I've begun new chapter at Albert. I do like to build pro bono when I can so if you have a project that might interest me shoot me an email to tadeasfort@proton.me. Cheers!
