## About Me

I found coding a little later in life while doing my masters. I haven't finished the latter, but picked up enough python there to propel me as data analyst at daytrip.com. During three years there I learned how to build scalable containerized backend APIs and ETL pipelines as well as plenty of typescript. Recently I've begun new chapter at Albert. I do like to build pro bono when I can so if you have a project that might interest me shoot me an email to business@tadeasfort.com. Cheers!
